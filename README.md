Background:
A Company NewGenTraining Ltd., has built up an infrastructure around the country for corporate training for corporations who have branches throughout the country. The following highlights the present status of the company’s training operations:
• Many companies have found the services appealing as they do not have to send personnel to Colombo for training.
• At present they have 20 training centers in 20 districts and each one of these centers is equipped with computers ranging from 20 to 40.
• There is a plan to establish 5 more centers in the remaining districts even though timeline is not very clear.
• Also there have been instances where these training centers in some of the districts unable to accommodate requests from companies for training due to limitations in the present center (Since the training center can accommodate only one training session for a given company at any given time).
• As a result of the above, company is considering establishing few additional centers in districts where there is a higher demand.
• None of the centers, at present, are inter-connected even though each one of them has local area network with at least one Layer 2 manageable switch.
The company’s top management had some concern on these centers’ dependency on corporate training and is planning to diversify their operations to online examinations where there is huge potential. Most of the examinations are targeted towards professional certifications and the awareness about these examinations is growing rapidly. Most, if not all, examination providers are reputed international companies.
In order to get certified as “Online Examination Provider”, NewGen Training Ltd, has to build a network with the following features:
• Network connecting all the training centers with a minimum of 2Mbps connectivity with a possibility of increasing link speed to 10Mbps on demand.
• Resiliency (Ability to withstand) to failures within the network in Sri Lanka
• Resiliency to failures in internet connectivity.
Requirements:
You have been recruited as Network Engineer of the newly established Networking Unit of company.
You are expected to carry out the following activities to complete this work:

1. The management has requested a comprehensive business plan to achieve the above. Management expects the plan to contain the following:
a. Type of technologies best suited for this type of network
b. Type of network devices required with their capabilities
c. Different ways of achieving resilience within the network of training centers
d. Different ways of achieving resilience in Internet connectivity so that Internet access from training centers is always available and load balancing can be done in cases of online examination being taken in large number of centers.
2. Conceptual Design of the overall network – This involves the complete physical and logical network topology and IP addressing scheme to facilitate the requirements listed above. Prepare a report that includes the following:
a. Draw the physical topology of the network clearly indicating L2 and L3 devices, indicating what features need to be present in L2 and L3 devices to support the requirements.
b. Draw the logical topology of the network.
c. Carry out the IP addressing for the entire network clearly indicating the subnet addresses. Use the IP block 10.10.0.0/20 for the entire network.
3. Once the logical network topology is completed, simulate the network using Cisco Packet Tracer.
